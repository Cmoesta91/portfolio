This is a simple product list website that uses Angular. I followed Deborah Kurata on Pluralsight to build this project.

It has a welcome page, a page for a list view of the products, and a page that displayes each product individually. It allows the user to show or hide the images as well as displaying stars for each items review. Clicking the stars displays the numeric value of each product in the header.
